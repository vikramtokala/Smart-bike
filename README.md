The practical project “Smart Bike” that gathers various information regarding the rider performance basing the sensors that are mounted on the bike. The sensors are interfaced using an Arduino UNO. This project also aims to provide the real-time assessment of a rider’s performance along with the increasing the ease of the operation of bicycle during the ride and to provide security features to the bike.

The project presents the usage of sensors like heartbeat sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, ultrasonic sensor for rear vehicle approach indication, GPS SD card logger for recording the details of the ride, LEDs for left and right indication and Hall effect sensor for measuring the cadence, speed, and distance travelled.

The information calculated is displayed on the LCD display which is provided with buttons which enable the user to alter the information.
